//! This example demonstrates how the `HartMask` structure operates in a non-`usize` environment.
//! It simulates a 128-bit RISC-V SBI environment where SBI calls only accept 128-bit parameters.
//! To represent a 128-bit SBI hart mask, we use the `HartMask<u128>` type to complete the SBI call procedure.

/* Code execution result analysis:
   The primary hart sends an IPI to all secondary harts using `HartMask::all()`, which
   represents a mask where all bits are set to 1. This triggers the `send_ipi` function
   to wake up all secondary harts. As a result, the output will be:
   - Primary hart is starting
   - Secondary hart 0 is waiting for interrupt
   - Secondary hart 1 is waiting for interrupt
   - ...
   - Secondary hart 7 is waiting for interrupt
   - Secondary hart 0 received interrupt
   - Secondary hart 1 received interrupt
   - ...
   - Secondary hart 7 received interrupt
   - Primary hart finished
   - Hart 0 stopped
   - Hart 1 stopped
   - ...
   - Hart 7 stopped
   - All harts stopped, emulation finished

   To test a scenario where only specific harts receive the IPI, modify the `send_ipi`
   call to use a custom `HartMask` with specific bits set. For example:
   `HartMask::from_raw(0b1010, 0)` would wake up harts with IDs 1 and 3.
