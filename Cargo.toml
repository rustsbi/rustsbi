default = []
# Run RustSBI on machine mode.
# This feature enables to use RISC-V primitives on current machine mode environment
# If you are developing a cross-architecture virtual machine, consider disabling this feature
# to customize environment variables for RISC-V architecture like mvendorid, mimpid, etc.
machine = ["rustsbi-macros/machine", "dep:riscv"]
# Enables the struct `Forward`.
# Struct `Forward` uses current SBI environment to implement the RustSBI environment.
# This feature is only usable when current software runs on another SBI environment,
# e.g. hypervisors for RISC-V architecture.
